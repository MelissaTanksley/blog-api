Backend API for A Web Developers Journey Blog Front End

## What is Working?
1. This is live https://beedev-blog-api.herokuapp.com/
2. Posts can be added
3. Login is working with seed users

## What is needed?
Here is what can be worked on

## AT THIS TIME PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH DATABASE FILES OTHER THAN TO VIEW

### 1) Register new user bug
There is currently a bug in the system that does not allow new users to be created

1. Seed users can log in
2. Please do not touch Seed files

### 2) Register roles
By default all new users are General users Admin by postman only

1. Create permissions for General, Basic, and Admin users
2. Change default role to Basic = this are are for commenting only roles
3. General users would be other users that wish to create a post
4. Admin remains postman add only but has permission to edit and delete all areas of database

### 3) Post Router
This needs finished

1. Finish CRUD operations for posts

### 4) Extra Router
This is for the comments.  A optional add on

1. All CRUD operations will be needed for this but there is no database part for this yet
2. server.js file will need to be updated once created

### 5) Documentation
There is a static public folder for the documentation

1. The HTML doc in the public folder will need to be finished after routes are tested. The layout is there just the data parts need to be fixed.
